# blackout
A simple webpage to (temporarily) blackout unused monitors.

When working in a multi-monitor setup, we sometimes may want to temporarily black out some of the displays.
However, turning them off would -- at least under Windows 10 -- mean that we lose the arrangement of any programs we have opened on them.

Some common use cases for blacking out some displays for me personally are:
* focus my work on just one of our displays
* reduce the "ambient" light when working at night
* hide sensitive information while demoing content

For convenience, this website is a very simplistic, easy to use, low impact solution to that problem. 

## Usage
Just open ```blackout.html``` in your browser and click anywhere on the page. 
This will open full screen mode.
To exit, press ```ESC``` on your keyboard.
